# Why Do We Need Design Patterns?

In software development, **one constant is change** (inspired by *Head First Design Patterns*). Requirements evolve, systems grow, and new features are added. Design patterns provide **proven solutions** that help us build software that is:

- **Maintainable**: Easy to update as requirements shift.  
- **Flexible**: Swap behaviors or extend features without rewriting core code.  
- **Reusable**: Apply the same patterns across different projects.  
- **Readable & Communicative**: Standard patterns make code intent instantly clear.  
- **Principle-Driven**: Encourages best practices like SOLID (program to interface, favor composition over inheritance).

**In short:** Design patterns are **blueprints for building resilient, scalable, and adaptable software** in a world where change is the only constant.

## Key Takeaway
Use design patterns to **embrace change, not fear it**, and to write code that lasts.
